# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
         Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and prediction of heart disease can significantly enhance patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment plans. Leveraging artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning models, can aid healthcare professionals in predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health indicators and patient data.​

			The aim of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on their medical history and current health data. The model should be able to analyze various features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other relevant health metrics to provide a prediction with high accuracy.​
